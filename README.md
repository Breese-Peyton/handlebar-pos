# Handlebar POS

Handlebar is a rental management application built for local operators such as bike shops, beach rental companies, and equipment rental businesses.

The goal of Handlebar is to provide a simple, modern alternative to bloated rental software by focusing on the workflows operators use every day: inventory, bookings, and checkout.
